# 👩 About me

Hi 👋, my name is Merna Alghannam. I moved from a small town in my home country to the United States in 2019, and I never really imagined to be where I am right today. ✨👩 💻 <br><br>

🏫 I am majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics and sociology @ Boston University. <br><br>
💼 I am a former SWE intern @ $\textcolor{yellow}{\text{Snapchat}}$, where I worked on a lens **recommender system**. <br><br>
💆 I enjoy painting, playing the violin, baking, and watching movies and basketball games.
