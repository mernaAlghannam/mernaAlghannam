Hi there 👋 <br>
My name is Merna Alghannam and I grew up in a small town in my home country. I never really imagined to be where I am right today. ✨👩 💻 
<br><br><br> At Boston University, I am majoring in computer science with a minor in mathematics and sociology. I am also a former SWE intern @ Snapchat, where I work on a lens recommender system.

Currently Working On 🚀
