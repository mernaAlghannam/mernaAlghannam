Currently Working On 🚀
- Low-budget Recipe Recommender | Web Development 📝 <br>
   - Current features: Using Spoonacular API (https://rapidapi.com/blog/build-food-website/), you can input your budget, nutrients, and diet and the app would recommend cheap recipes based on your input.
   - Additional Potential Features: <br>
         - Input the end date of your ingredients. Then, the app will ping you when a food item is nearing its expiration date.<br>
         - A feature that allows the app to recommend recipes based on the ingredients you have. 

 - Twitter Text Analysis Tool- Background: Twitter has allegedly stopped moderating content and returned controversial leaders back on the plaform. So, I'm developing a tool that tracks how these changes impacted traffic on Twitter | NLP, computational social science📜⛏️
