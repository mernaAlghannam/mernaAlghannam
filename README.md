Hi there 👋 <br>
My name is Merna Alghannam. I moved from a small town in my home country to the United States in 2019, and I never really imagined to be where I am right today. ✨👩 💻 
<br><br><br> At Boston University, I am majoring in computer science with a minor in mathematics and sociology. I'm also a former SWE intern @ Snapchat, where I worked on a lens recommender system.

Currently Working On 🚀
- Low-budget Recipe Recommender | Web Development 📝

 - Twitter Text Analysis Tool- Background: Twitter has allegedly stopped moderating content and returned controversial leaders back on the plaform. So, I'm developing a tool that tracks how these changes impacted traffic on Twitter | NLP📜⛏️
